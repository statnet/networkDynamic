\title{
Extracts the edge timing information from a networkDynamic object and represent as a data.frame.
}
\description{
Creates a data.frame giving lists of edges and their activity spells corresponding to the networkDynamic object.

\usage{
\method{as.data.frame}{networkDynamic}(x, row.names = NULL, optional = FALSE,
                                       e =seq_along(x$mel),
                                       start = NULL, end = NULL, active.default=TRUE,...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a networkDynamic object}
  \item{row.names}{ignored}
  \item{optional}{ignored}
  \item{e}{vector of edge ids that should be included in the output.}
  \item{start}{Left-censoring time: time at which the network was first
    observed. Edge spells with onset \code{-Inf} are given this
    as their start time (and marked as left censored). See Details for
    the default values.}
  \item{end}{Right-censoring time: time at which the network was last
    observed. Edge spells with terminus \code{Inf} are given this
    as their end time (and marked as right censored). See Details for
    the default values.}
  \item{active.default}{logical indicating if edges with no defined a
  ctivity spells should be considered active by default 
  (and appear as a row in output)}
  \item{\dots}{possible additional arguments}
}
\details{
Represents the edge dynamics of a networkDynamic object as a data frame giving lists of edges and their activity spells, including whether an activity spell was
"censored". If \code{x} has \code{attr}-style attribute \code{"start"},
it will be used as the left-censoring time and similarly for
\code{"end"} and right-censoring time.
}
\value{
A \code{\link{data.frame}} containing timed relational information
describing the networkDynamic object, having the following columns:
\item{onset, terminus}{Onset and terminus times of an edge, respectively, if
  not censored, and left and right censoring times, if censored.}
\item{tail, head}{Tail and head of the edge.}
\item{onset.censored, terminus.censored}{TRUE if onset/terminus time is censored.}
\item{duration}{the duration (terminus-onset) of each spell, evaluated after censoring}
\item{edge.id}{the id of the edge the row corresponds to}
The output \code{data.frame} will be sorted by edge.id, onset,terminus. This means that for most (non-multiplex) networks the group of spells for a specific edge will appear in sequential lines of output, but the overall output is not in a temporal order. 
}

\note{
Vertex and attribute activity is not included in the returned value. If an edge has multiple activity spells, it will have multiple rows in the output.

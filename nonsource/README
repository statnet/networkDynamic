IMPORTANT NOTES FOR networkDynamic DEVELOPERS---------------------------------


Where things go in the networkDynamic archive:

 - The package TODO file remains in the trunk root.

 - Specifications and other developer documentation resides in the
   docs.und.specifications directory.

 - The package itself sits in its usual spot.

 - If there are other important addons (e.g., testing code, data for
   tests, etc.), then these should be added in appropriate subdirectories from
   the trunk root.  (If need be, these may get moved later.)

Some additional reminders:

 - networkDynamic should be considered FOUNDATIONAL CODE.  That means that
   changes may break existing data objects, programs, etc., making you the
   enemy of all who live.  Resist the urge to go all cowboy and whatnot.
 
 - Please read the specifications and man pages before doing anything that
   might change behavior, including adding new functions or options.  Always
   write to spec - if the spec needs to be changed, propose edits there
   first.  If the spec is not currently documented, please document the
   missing portion.  Etc.

 - Anything that can reasonably/easily be done at the user level, and/or that
   is not highly generic in functionality, should probably not be in this 
   package.  The goal is to provide a quorum of highly reliable, reasonably
   efficient low-level tools from which users and other developers can 
   construct more elaborate applications.  Adding lots of new features can
   seem like a good idea at first, but leads to maintenance and compatibility
   nightmares down the road.  (You and others may have to live with this code
   for 10+ years, if you are lucky.  Don't get fancy.)


Thanks to all!
